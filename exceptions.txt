exception propogation:
	if an exception happens in a method
		if it is handled inside that method then code will proceed normally
		if not handled the exception is propogated to the calling function
				in this case calling function is responsible to handle 
		finally block will be executed in all situations


User defined exceptions / custom exceptions / application specific exceptions
	create a class extending Exception (checked) or RuntimeException (unchecked)
	To make this exception happen:
			create object
			throw the object
	At this point it is taken as the exception happened
	Any calling method is communicated about the situation through this exception
