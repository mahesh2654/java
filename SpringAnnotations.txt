With annotations, we can use AnnotationConfigApplicationContext
	This container needs Config class as argument

@Configuration
		class which provides configuration
		this class can be used to create multiple beans
		methods with @Bean annotations can be included in this class
		
@ComponentScan(basePackages="package name")
		used to search for beans under the base package
		this annotation is to be given in config class

@Component
	defines a bean
	cannot create more than one bean for this class
	beane id is same as class name with first letter converted to lowercase
	if we want other id, give it as  @Component("id")

@Service -- same as component
@Repository -- same as component

@Autowired   
	used to autowire another bean
	Matching done with type of bean
	if more than one bean of same type available, we need to use @Qualifier("id")
	
@Qualifier  <-- explained above
	
@scope()
@PostCreate   <-- this methods executes when bean is created
@PreDestroy   <--  this method executed when bean is destroyed( all beans destroyed when container is closed)
