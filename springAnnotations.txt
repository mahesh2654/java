Annotation configuration
-------------------------------

in XML we need to specify <context:annotation-config />

@Autowired <-- autowiring by type (if more than one bean then autowired by name)
							if not possible to autowire bytpye ot byname, we need to provide @Qualifier

@Qualifier("id") <-- used to identify a aprticular bean for autowiring
							  This should always be used with @Autowired

@Component <-- used to define a bean in the class itself. Not required to define in XML
						id of the bean is automatically the class name with first letter in lower case

@Service  <-- similar to @Component but used for service classes
@Repository <-- same as @Component

@Value  <-- used to supply values for simple properties like int, float, String etc		

@PropertySource  <-- used to identify properties file

@Configuration	  <-- used for a class which is capable of configuring beans.
						This class should have methods with @Bean annatation and return onjects
@Bean

@PostConstruct
@PreDestroy
