 Data objects on client and server should match
Service class should have HttpClient provided through dependency injection
Add HttpClientModule to AppModule imports(import mannually if suggest does not work)
			import {HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';
In the service class provide methods to handle data with HttpClient
	If the response is object convertable to json -- OK
	If the response is string (not convertable to JSON) 
					-- use additional parameter {responseTyp:'text'} inside HttpClient methods
	HttpClient get() and delete() methods need URL as argument
	HttpClient post() and put() methods need URL as first argument and object as second argument
	
	All the methods of HttpClient return Observable.
