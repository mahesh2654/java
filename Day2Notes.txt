static variable 
	common to all objects
	only one copy exists in memory irrespective of number of objects
	can be accessed by all objects
	also called as class level variable
	
static methods
		methods declared as static
		can only refer static vriables
		can only call static methods
		they are also refered as class level methods
		these methods can be called using any object reference
		they can call using class name

Object creation process:
	allocate storage for object in heap memory
	initialize all fileds 
	constructor is executed
	return the address (reference) of the object
	
Garbage collection
	process to remove unrefered objects from heap memory
	automatically done in java
	garbage collector (part of JRE) periodically does the garbage collection
	finalize() method is automatically called when object is garbage collected
	we can request for garbage collection by calling System.gc()
	
Arrays
		arrays in java are objects
		declare array reference
					int x[];  // no array is created
					int [] x
		int x[] = new int[10];  // creates array objec capable of storing 10 integers 
		x= new int[100] ; new array with 100 integers is assiged to x. array created at line 33 is garbage collected
		
		array elemnts are automatically initialized to default value
		we can access any array element using index
		x[0]=32;  	// first element value will be 32
		x[4]=120;	// 5th element value will be 120
		
		array size is available through array.length
		all elemnts can be accessed using for loop
		
		for(int i=0; i < x.length;i++){
		  System.out.println(x[i])
		}
		
		trying to access element not in the range leads to ArrayIndexOutofBoundsException
		
		to create initalized array
		     int x[]= {23,45,67,12,87,43};
			 
		special loop for arrays (for each loop or enhanced for loop):
		----------------------------------------------------------------------------
		format:
			for(datatype variable: array){
				// variable will contain one element of the array
			}
		
			for(int a: x){
				System.out.println(a)
		}
		
Array of objects:
	array of objects is simply array of references
	default value for references is null
