What is JWT:
	String containing data using a secret key
	JWT can be created if secret key is known
	we can select type of encryption algorithm
	
	Every token contains 3 parts --> header, payload, signature
						hhhhh.ppppppp.sssssss
	payload contains data which can be accessed by decoding token
	secret key not required to decode payload

Implementing security with JWT:

		User login
		server checks for credentials (username and password)
		server sends a token (JWT) to the client
		JWT is kept on the client side (angular saves it in browser localStorage)
		To send next request, JWT is attached to the request(in the header)  as below
				Authorization: Bearer <token>
		server checks the token and if it is valid and allows to access the controller method

		JWT can be set with expiration time

		When user logout, token is deleted on client side (removed from localStorage)

Spring Boot JWT application:
	1. add dependency for JWT
				implementation 'io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt:0.9.1'
	2. Create a class JwtUtil to have methods for JWT
					-- create a token
					-- validate the token
					-- check expiration of token
					--  etc
	3. Create AuthenticationController with login method
				-- check username and password supplied in the request
				-- if valid, use JwtUtil to generate token and send token as a reponse
				-- if not valid throw login exception
