inheritance:
===========

all features of superclass are available in subclass
construcors are not inherited
superclass constructor has to be called by subclass constructor  using super()

any method not suitable in subclass can be redefined (overriding)
overriding means having same return type, same name and same arguments

while overriding 
         1. subclass method cannot have less access than superclass method
		 2. subclass method cannot throw exception which is not thrown by superclass method
		 
Use @Override annotation to check that overriding is correctly done
to call super class  method which was overriden, use super.method()
